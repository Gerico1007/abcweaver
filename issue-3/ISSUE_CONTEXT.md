## Issue Information
- **Number**: #3
- **Repository**: gerico1007/abcweaver
- **Title**: Fix duration calculation: Quarter notes incorrectly converted to whole notes
- **State**: OPEN
- **URL**: https://github.com/Gerico1007/abcweaver/issues/3
- **Labels**: assembly, synth, full-orchestration

## Issue Description
## Issue Description

When converting ABC notation to MusicXML, quarter notes are incorrectly transformed into whole notes due to wrong duration calculation.

## Expected Behavior

ABC notation `C4 D4 E4 F4` (quarter notes) should convert to MusicXML with duration=2 (quarter note duration).

## Actual Behavior

ABC quarter notes convert to MusicXML with duration=8, creating whole notes that last 4 beats each instead of 1 beat.

## Technical Details

- **ABC Input**: `C4 D4 | E4 F4 | G4 A4 | B4 c4 |` (quarter notes in 4/4 time)
- **XML Output**: `<duration>8</duration>` with `<divisions>2</divisions>`
- **Result**: Each note lasts 4 beats (8÷2) instead of 1 beat (2÷2)

## Solution

For quarter notes in 4/4 time with divisions=2:
- Current: `<duration>8</duration>` ❌
- Should be: `<duration>2</duration>` ✅

## Test Files

- ABC: `test.abc` - Contains quarter note melody
- XML: `test.xml` - Shows incorrect whole note durations

This affects rhythm accuracy in all ABC to MusicXML conversions.
